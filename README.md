# Pomodoro App React Solution #


In this [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pomodoro-app-KBFnycJ6G/hub),  I learned a lot, for example, I don't know before this challenge how to make a circular bar and sync with time. The Pomodoro script itself is easy, but CSS and synced progress bar gives a problem. But I learned new things, and this is cool ðŸ˜…

*In this project, I use this technology:*
- React
- Vite
- SCSS
- Use-local-storage(it's a custom hook to work with localStorage)
